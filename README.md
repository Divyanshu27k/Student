Student Management System is a desktop application developed in Java Swing for managing student records with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.
The system allows users to easily add new students, view existing student data, update records, and delete entries. 
It connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve student information securely. 
The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern to maintain clean and modular code. 
A JTable is used to display student data dynamically, providing an intuitive user interface for interacting with the records. 
The system includes form validation, error handling, and a user-friendly interface for efficient data management. 
The project supports operations like searching for students by name or ID and can be extended with additional features such as uploading student images. 
This system is ideal for educational institutions that need an easy-to-use solution for managing student records digitally.
The integration of Java Swing and MySQL ensures a scalable, reliable, and interactive desktop application.
